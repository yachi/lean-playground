# LeanPlayground

A playground for doing mathematics in Lean 4 with Mathlib.

API docs: <https://yachi.github.io/lean-playground/> (rebuilt by CI on every push to `main`).

## Setup

The toolchain comes from [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) and [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan).
`mise.toml` pins elan and puts `~/.elan/bin` on `PATH` inside this directory.
`lean-toolchain` pins the Lean version, and elan installs it on first use.

```fish
mise install
elan-init -y --default-toolchain none --no-modify-path  # once per machine
lake exe cache get   # download prebuilt Mathlib (~9k files); never build Mathlib from source
lake build
```

## Layout

- `LeanPlayground/` — playground files. Each file starts with `module` and `public import Mathlib`.
- `LeanPlayground.lean` — the library root. Import every new file here so `lake build` checks it.

## Formalizations

### The productegral — `LeanPlayground/Productegral/`

Claims from Sohil Rathi, [*The Missing Calculus Operation*](https://youtu.be/QN680Is4euw)
(YouTube, 2026-10-12), proved with Mathlib. The productegral `∏ f(x)^dx` is defined as
`exp (∫ log f)`. Each theorem's doc comment quotes the claim and its video timestamp.

| File | Claims |
|---|---|
| `Finite.lean` | Bar sums and products: 15, 120, 3543.75, about 59.5, about 45, 4^0.01 ≈ 1.014 |
| `Integrals.lean` | ∫x = 12.5, ∫log x = 5 log 5 − 5, the value (5/e)^5 ≈ 21.06, the line length (t/e)^t |
| `Limits.lean` | The bar products converge to (5/e)^5; the n! ≈ (n/e)^n approximation |
| `Decrease.lean` | The bar products strictly decrease for every bar count N ≥ 1 |
| `MulCalculus.lean` | The multiplying slope of 2^x is 2; multiplicative FTC: ∏ (f*)^dx = f(b)/f(a) |

Two claims are false as stated, so the files prove the corrected forms:

- **2:03, "exactly 45":** the third-width product is 45.0015, and `riemannProduct_id_fifteen_ne_45` proves it is not 45.
- **6:17, "n! is about (n/e)^n":** this is true only for n-th roots. `tendsto_factorial_div_pow_atTop` proves that the ratio `n! / (n/e)^n` tends to infinity.

## Update Mathlib

```fish
lake update
```

The `update.yml` workflow also opens a pull request when a new Mathlib release is out.
